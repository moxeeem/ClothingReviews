## Project Description

In this project, we use transformers to predict product ratings and to determine the tone of the review based on preprocessed customer text reviews.

## Dataset
We use [Women‚Äôs Clothing E-Commerce dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews) revolving around the reviews written by customers

This dataset includes 23486 rows and 10 feature variables. Each row corresponds to a customer review, and includes the variables:

|Feature|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`Clothing ID`|Integer|Variable that refers to the specific piece being reviewed.|
|`Age`|Integer|Variable of the reviewers age.|
|`Title`|String|Variable for the title of the review.|
|`Review Text`|String|Variable for the review body.|
|**`Rating`**|Integer|Variable for the product score granted by the customer from 1 Worst, to 5 Best.|
|**`Recommended IND`**|Integer|Variable stating where the customer recommends the product where 1 is recommended, 0 is not recommended.|
|`Positive Feedback Count`|Integer|Variable documenting the number of other customers who found this review positive.|
|`Division Name`|String|Categorical name of the product high level division.|
|`Department Name`|String|Categorical name of the product department name.|
|`Class Name`|String|Categorical name of the product class name.


## Preprocessing

In the process of text preprocessing, we employ methods such as tokenization, POS-tagging, and lemmatization. All these operations are carried out using the nltk library. Additionally, we remove stop words and convert the text to lowercase. 

## Binary Classification

We use  `bert-base-uncased` to binary classification for predicting whether the review is positive or negative.

**f1 score**: 0.8507015684469733 
**number of epochs**: 10

The classifier does its job well. For successful classification, it is necessary to write a review using a sufficient number of explicit evaluative words.


## Multiclass Classification

We use `distilroberta-base` to multiclass classification for predicting the rating of the product.

**f1 score**: 0.6033866825602262
**number of epochs**: 20

Overall accuracy for each class:
- Class 0: 0.24
- Class 1: 0.31
- Class 2: 0.34
- Class 3: 0.35
- Class 4: 0.81

The classifier confuses classes that are close in value, for example: class 2 with 1 and 3.
The classifier distinguishes classes well at a distance, for example: class 4 is little confused with class 0.
Most likely, this result was due to an unbalanced dataset.
